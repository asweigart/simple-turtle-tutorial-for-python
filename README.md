# simple-turtle-tutorial-for-python
A simple tutorial for Python's turtle.py. This tutorial is written using common English words (like the Simple English Wikipedia is written) so it can easily translate into other languages.

Please read https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_Simple_English_pages

This tutorial and its translations will be published on ReadTheDocs.org. This tutorial is not meant to replace the official turtle.py documentation.

The "Prime Directives" of this tutorial are:

* This tutorial is written in simple English, understandable by children and non-native English speakers.
* This tutorial covers the turtle.py module, but not programming or Python.
* This is not a project-based tutorial, but instead a simple list of all the turtle functions with examples.
* The Python code in this tutorial should be kept simple. No recursion, classes, list comprehensions, or complicated data structures. Programs should be under 30 lines.
* This tutorial's code should work with Python 2 and Python 3.


As the Tortuga project translates the turtle.py module into other languages, this tutorial can be adapted to use those translated modules.
